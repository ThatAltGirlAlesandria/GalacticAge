## Description

This project is meant to showcase my ability to run Jest for a Test Driven Development environment, while also showcasing my ability to set up my own Template and utilize it for projects. This project will allow users to input their current age on Earth and what they believe their expected age will be. The program will then output a conversion of their age on Mars, Venus, Mercury, and Jupiter. This is similar to do years, how every 1 human year is 7 dog years. For every year on Earth, it is .24 years on Mercury, .62 years on Venus, 1.88 years on Mars, and 11.86 years on Jupiter (time goes by QUICK on Jupiter). This project does not currently have any UI logic or capabilities, however, this may be added later.
